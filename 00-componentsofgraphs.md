To understand ggplot, you need to ask yourself, what are the fundamental parts of every data graph? They are:

- Aesthetics – these are the roles that the variables play in each graph. A variable may control where points appear, the color or shape of a point, the height of a bar and so on.
- Geoms – these are the geometric objects. Do you need bars, points, lines?
- Statistics – these are the functions like linear regression you might need to draw a line.
- Scales – these are legends that show things like circular symbols represent females while circles represent males.
- Facets – these are the groups in your data. Faceting by gender would cause the graph to repeat for the two genders.
