### The grammar of graphics
- Wilkinson addresses the question of “what is a statistical graphic?”
- Mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (e.g. colour, shape and size) of geometric objects (e.g. points, lines and bars)
- Remark: geometric objects are referred to as “geoms”.
- Wickham’s layered graphics approach is based on Wilkinson’s grammar, but adapts it to fit it into the R environment.

### Layered grammar
Layered grammar defines a plot as the combination of
- A default data set and a setting of mappings from variables to aesthetics
- One or more layers
- One scale for each aesthetic mapping
- A coordinate system
- The faceting specification

### Layers
Layers are responsible for creating the objects on the plot. Layers are composed of 4 parts
1) Data / aesthetic mapping
2) A statistical transformation (stat)
3) A geometric object (geom)
4) Position adjustment
