\section*{Plot Character}
The default plot character is a “hollow” circle. We can change the type of plot character used by specifying a value to the \textbf{\texttt{pch=}} argument. We can  change the colour using the \textbf{\texttt{col=}} argument.
\begin{framed}
	\begin{verbatim}
	plot(x,y, pch = 16, col="red")
	\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

### Changing your plot character}

To change the plot character (the symbol for each covariate, we supply an additional argument to the plot() function.  This argument is formulated as pch=n where n is some number.
Additionally we change the colour of the characters, by specifying a colour in the col argument.
\large <pre><code>
plot(x,y,pch=15,col="red")#Square plot symbols
plot(x,y,pch=16,col="green")#Orb plot symbols
plot(x,y,pch=17,col="mauve")#Triangular plot symbols
plot(x,y,pch=36,col="amber")#Dollar sign plot symbols
</code></pre>\large
Recall that we can add new variates to an existing scatterplot using the points() function. Remember to set the vertical and horizontal limits accordingly.
\large <pre><code>
y1 = rnorm(10); y2 = rnorm(10)
plot(x,y1, pch=8,col="purple" ,xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(-5,5))
points(x,y2,pch=12,col="green")
</code></pre>
