#### *{Combining Plots}
Multiple plots can be combined into a single graph, arranged vertically, horizontally or in a grid.

This can be implemented with ``par( )`` function, specifying the arrangment using the ``mfrow`` argument.

Suppose we require a histogram above a boxplot (with horizontal orientation). 
If we consider this as a grid, we have an array of two rows, with one column.

<pre>
<code>
# 2 plots arranged in 2 rows and 1 column


par(mfrow=c(2,1))


hist(mtcars$wt, main="Histogram of wt",col=c("lightblue","blue"))
boxplot(mtcars$
wt, main="Boxplot of wt",horizontal=TRUE,col="lightblue")

</code>
</pre>
